            <h2>Videogames</h2>
            <p>
                Today games are not just a funny thing for kids. Nowadays videogames became a facinating adventure with the gorgeous plot and some realy emotional moments. Some games can be that
                emotional, that touching so they can even change your life. And creators of this games want to tell you something realy important. They may give you the
                choice to do something and it isn't going to be easy. So you can see some examples of great games and screenshots of them on your left.
            </p>
            <h2>Cinematography</h2>
            <p>
                Movies were always a part of art. The actors, directors and even the whole team want to tell us something. And there are different kinds of movies that you can watch but today i want to speak about the most emotional ones. So that's
                why i love franch cinematography. You can see this pure feelings in there. So you can see some screenshot of one great franch film on your left.
                Of course there are some great movies from the UK, USA etc. I love movies from
                the UK cause they have this elegance and also this film about Bond that you can see on your left have that emotional moments, that drama that you
                don't always see in action movies. Lots of countries have
                something to be proud of in this sphere.
            </p>
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
                For me music is playing the huge role in everything. I can't live without music. And soundracks also a big part of early mentioned videogames and movies.
                By the way Low Roar did lots of tracks for Death Stranding.
                They help you to dive into the process. I listen to different genres of music. Each genre can give you this special experience that not nothing else
                could give. By creating song musicians want to tell us a story throught the feelings they express by not always singing. It can be just instrumental thing,
                without words but you will understand everything. So on your left you can see coupple of albums, pictures and songs of these groups that I wanted to show you.
                And I've placed couple of soundracks for the games, movies that I mentioned earlier.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                All this three genres are conected. There is a lot of games, movies and songs that I want to tell you about.
                They are all gorgeous, but I've told you about ones that I recently enjoyed.
                Maybe someday I'll tell about all this fabulous things but unfortunately today I have no time for this.
                So maybe see you next time on this website. Bye

            <h1>Expression of Feelings</h1>
            <p>
                It's very important to express your feelings. And there's a lot of ways to do this. From baking to making websites. Different people do it differently.
                I wish you'll find your own way to transform yor feelings into something gorgeous. I myself am a realy artistic person. I try to express my feelings in everything
                I do. From the preparation of the presentation to making a coffee. But today I'm not going to tell you about coffee, I'm going to tell you about my three favorite
                ways to undertand people's emotions. This ways are movies, videogames and music.
            </p>
